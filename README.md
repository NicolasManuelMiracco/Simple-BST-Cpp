# Simple-BST-Cpp
Binary Search Tree Implementation in C++

The provided code defines a simple implementation of a binary search tree (BST) in C++. It includes a `TreeNode` class to represent the nodes of the tree and a `BinarySearchTree` class to handle the tree operations. The `BinarySearchTree` class features methods to insert values recursively and to perform an in-order traversal to verify the structure of the tree. The `main` function tests these functionalities by creating a BST from an array of integers and then printing the tree in in-order sequence to display the sorted values.
